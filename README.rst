A simple program for paging through text files from the command line.


To-Do
=====
The following items are still to-do before the initial release of the
package:

*   Remove next command when at the last page of the document.
*   Allow invocation with arguments.
*   Implement the jump command.
*   Implement the load command.

The following are nice to have features for future releases:

*   Manage the flowing of text with curses better.
